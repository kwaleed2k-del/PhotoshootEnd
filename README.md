# Studio AI: The End of the Photoshoot

## 🚀 Core Concept & Introduction

Traditional photoshoots are the biggest bottleneck for modern fashion and e-commerce brands. They are incredibly **expensive**, requiring models, photographers, studios, and stylists. They are painstakingly **slow**, with weeks passing from shoot to final assets. And they are **logistically complex**, demanding immense coordination.

**Studio AI is the solution.**

This is an AI-powered virtual content studio designed to completely eliminate the need for physical photoshoots. It empowers brands to generate an infinite variety of world-class, commercially-ready visuals—on-model, on-product, and on-demand—at a fraction of the cost and time.

## ✨ Detailed Feature Breakdown

The platform is organized into three powerful, interconnected studios, each tailored to a specific workflow.

### 👕 The Apparel Studio: Virtual Try-On & On-Model Imagery

This is the heart of the platform, where your clothing meets your models.

*   **Upload Your Model:** Preserve your brand's unique identity. Upload an image of your own model, and our AI will maintain their face and body with stunning accuracy for true-to-brand virtual try-ons.
*   **AI Model Agency:** Don't have a model? Choose from our diverse library of professionally generated AI talent, or use the **AI Model Prompter** to create a completely new, exclusive model from a text description. You can even **save generated models** to your private "My Agency" roster for perfect consistency across campaigns.
*   **Intelligent Wardrobe:** Upload one or more flat-lay images of your apparel. The AI automatically analyzes each garment's category (top, outerwear, etc.) and the **AI Stylist** can even suggest the correct layering order.
*   **The Virtual Photoshoot:** This is where the magic happens. The AI seamlessly fuses your model and apparel into a single, photorealistic image. It understands fabric drape, creates natural wrinkles, and matches lighting and shadows perfectly.
*   **AI Art Director:** Feeling uninspired? Our AI assistant analyzes your garment and suggests complete photoshoot concepts—poses, lighting, backgrounds—that best match its style.

### 📦 The Product Studio: Dynamic Staging & Scene Creation

Elevate your product photography from simple cutouts to stunning lifestyle scenes.

*   **AI Background Removal:** Upload any product photo, and the AI will instantly and perfectly remove the background, giving you a clean asset to work with.
*   **Interactive Staging Canvas:** Go beyond text prompts. Visually arrange your product and companion assets (like packaging) on a simple 2D canvas. Drag, drop, scale, and layer your items, and the AI will replicate your exact composition in the final photorealistic render.
*   **AI Prop Assistant:** Need to add some life to your scene? Click "Suggest Props," and the AI will analyze your product and recommend relevant, artistic props to add to your shot.
*   **Hyper-Realistic Material Engine:** Specify your product's material—`Matte`, `Glossy`, `Metallic`, `Glass`—and the AI will render light, shadows, and reflections with incredible accuracy.

### 🎨 The Design Studio: The Ultimate Mockup Engine

From a simple graphic to a finished product shot in seconds.

*   **Live Design Preview:** No more guessing. As you upload your mockup (e.g., a blank t-shirt) and your design file, you get a real-time, interactive preview.
*   **WYSIWYG Placement Controls:** Adjust the scale, rotation, and position of your design with sliders and see the changes happen live on the preview canvas. What you see is what you get.
*   **AI Graphic Designer:** Don't have a design? Describe one. Use our Imagen-powered generator to create logos, graphics, and typography from a simple text prompt.
*   **Advanced Realism Engine:** Control how your design interacts with the garment. Use the "Fabric Blend" slider and "Wrinkle Conforming" toggle to create mockups that are indistinguishable from real life.
*   **One-Click Colorway Generator:** Add a list of color codes, and the AI will automatically generate your mockup in every single color variation.

### ⚡ Platform Power-Ups: Features Across All Studios

These tools enhance every workflow, providing professional-grade efficiency and quality.

*   **One-Click Asset Packs:** Stop manually resizing and cropping. Generate a complete set of assets from a single setup, including **E-commerce Packs** (front, back, detail shots), **Social Media Packs** (1:1 and 9:16 aspect ratios), or a **Complete Asset Pack** that combines both.
*   **Generative Video:** Bring your static images to life. Animate your final creations with subtle motion, perfect for product pages and social media ads.
*   **AI Post-Production Suite:** Your final image is just the beginning. Apply professional color grades, add a subtle film grain, or use the **Generative Edit** tool to make fine-tuned changes with a simple text prompt.
*   **"Looks" & Scene Templating:** Save any combination of settings—camera, lighting, background, props—as a reusable "Look." Apply it to any new product or model for perfect brand consistency with a single click.

## 🔐 Internal Billing Sanity Checks

Before flipping on paid flows, run the Stripe/Credits sanity tools:

- CLI: `pnpm stripe:sanity`
- API: `curl -H "X-Admin-Token: $INTERNAL_ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/_internal/stripe-sanity`

The CLI shares logic with the API route and exits non-zero if any required env, DB constraint, or active credit package mapping fails validation.

## 💳 Buying Credit Packages

- Set `APP_BASE_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` in `.env.local`) so checkout redirects resolve correctly.
- Seed defaults: `pnpm seed:credit-packages`, then enable a package + add a Stripe Price ID via `/admin/credit-packages`.
- Local Stripe test flow:
  1. `stripe login`
  2. `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhooks`
  3. Visit `/billing/credits`, click **Buy**, complete checkout with `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
  4. Credits are granted via the webhook once Stripe confirms payment; resend events with `stripe events resend <evt_id>` to verify idempotency.

## 🔑 Authentication Setup

- Configure Supabase and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` so the browser client can create sessions.
- Use `AUTH_ENFORCE=true` once you want middleware to require real logins; during demo periods set `AUTH_ENFORCE=false` and seed `DEMO_SESSION_USER_ID=<uuid>` so server code gracefully falls back.
- Users sign up at `/signup`, log in at `/login`, and authenticated areas (`/dashboard`, `/billing/**`, `/admin/**`) are protected automatically.
- Logging out clears the `sb-access-token` cookie so APIs relying on `getSessionUser()` immediately reflect the new state.
